# simple-game-portfolio
Hello my name is Nagato, and this is a personal project I am working on this summer, 2025.\
This project will be for a website that will acts as a portfolio for showcasing projects I created.

This is still a _work in progress_, and will be worked on throughout the summer.
So far, I have accomplished to replicate the Chrome dino game, and am currently working on making a multiplayer air hockey game.
I am also working on a web design with Sakura [Sakurakanqkababsn](https://github.com/Sakurakanqkababsn) and once this is completed, I plan to create my original online card game to wrap up this project.
